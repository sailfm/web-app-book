# Building Web Apps with NodeJS and Hapi (Work in Progress)

*Building Web Apps with AWS* teaches the fundamentals of building web apps with NodeJS and Hapi. It couples practical examples with conceptual explanations so that you learn not just how to follow instructions but also what each instruction does and why. Readers will learn how to build web apps by building one - a Readability proxy with playlists, RSS, audio playback, and more.

The target audience is software developers who are comfortable with Javascript. [Eloquent Javascript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) is a good book for those without prior Javascript experience to learn the basics.

This book is about building, not deploying web apps. Readers are encouraged to also read [Deploying Web Apps with AWS](https://aws.sail.fm). This book should be read sequentially, as each section assumes familiarity with the concepts explained in prior sections.
